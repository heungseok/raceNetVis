# F1 racing network visualization
Formula one (F1) racing drivers’ competitive network and collisions.

This is an origin work of visualization of ["Escalation of competition into conflict in competitive networks of Formula One drivers"](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3361), and this work present how the overlapped networks are visualized through the given data with R language.

## Prerequisites
- R
- iGraph package
- Data (edge list)

## How to use
TBD

Drivers’ competitive network and collisions. Nodes are drivers. Nodes encircled in black are labeled by name. Edges denote joint competition in at least one race. Red edges connecting nodes indicate that the two drivers collided at least once. Using Fruchterman–Reingold, nodes are generally proximate to the extent that their average structural equivalence (over all races, from 1970 to 2014) is high.
